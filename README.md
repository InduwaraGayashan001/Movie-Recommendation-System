# Movie-Recommendation-System

This project involves analyzing and utilizing the MovieLens 25M dataset, a rich collection of movie ratings and user-generated tags from the MovieLens recommendation service. The dataset contains over 25 million ratings and 1 million tag applications for more than 62,000 movies, contributed by 162,541 users between 1995 and 2019. The aim of the project is to explore, analyze, and develop models to enhance movie recommendations using this extensive dataset. Key components include understanding user preferences, identifying patterns in movie genres, and leveraging the tag genome for personalized recommendations. This project offers a valuable opportunity to apply machine learning and data analysis techniques to a large-scale real-world dataset.
